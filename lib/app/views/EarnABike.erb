      <h2>Earn A Bike</h2>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;">The
      Bike Depot offers programs for adults and youth to earn donated
      bicycles through education and service work.&nbsp; All programs
      require participants take a class on safe riding, minor repairs and
      other services the Bike Depot offers.&nbsp; Most programs also
      require participants fix up their chosen bike with the help of our
      volunteer mechanics.&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;">The
      Earn A Bike program is made possible by the generous support of our
      bicycle donors and funders.&nbsp; Unwanted bikes, which would
      otherwise end up in landfills, are refurbished by the members of
      our community who need them the most.&nbsp; If you would like to
      donate a bike or host a bicycle drive in your community please
      click <a href=
      "http://www.thebikedepot.org/betasiteerb/support/donate-bikes"
      target="_blank">HERE</a> to learn more.&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;">Our
      goals are to create new cyclists in order to increase personal
      health and wellness, provide viable transportation solutions for
      commuting and trips to the store and around the city, and to help
      repair the environment locally and globally.&nbsp; We believe that
      giving people the power of autonomy and freedom a bike provides
      improves our community in small, but very important ways.&nbsp;
      Bikes can change the world and we are making that happen one
      donated and earned bicycle at a time.</span></p>
