        James is a long time bike enthusiast who cut his teeth on wrenching
        in the co-ops and community shops of Portland, OR and when not
        working on bikes he will occasionally ride them.&nbsp; A native of
        the great state of Maine, James received his BS Ed. in
        Career/Technical &amp; Technology Education along with Minor in Art
        Education from the University of Idaho in 2010. &nbsp;His dream is
        to someday set up a High School Tradeâ€™s Program with a focus on
        Wood &amp; Metal Work and Bicycle Mechanics.&nbsp; It could happen.
        &nbsp;His wife Jeneve and little dog Charlie are the center of his
        universe.</em></span></p>
