            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;">Fix
            Your Bike is our flagship program where anyone can come to our shop
            during designated hours (see below) to utilize our space, tools and
            knowledge to fix their bikes. &nbsp;It is a wonderful opportunity
            to meet your neighbors and others in the community that have a
            common interest in bicycles of all kinds.&nbsp; The music is always
            bumping, the grease a-flying and bike passion burning!&nbsp; We
            welcome everyone, regardless of bike clout, cool factor, gender,
            race, income, etc.&nbsp;</span></p>

            do not need prior bicycle knowledge</span><span style=
            "font-size:14px;">, we have Volunteer Mechanics on hand to help
            with your maintenance and repair questions. The help of our
            volunteers is free, but all parts, both new and used, are sold
            separately. &nbsp;As always, Bike Depot Members receive a discount
            on parts and accessories.&nbsp; We have 6 benches, two wheel truing
            stations, a tube patching table and most any specialized tool you
            could want for wrenching bikes.</span></p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style=

            answer questions, <strong><em>but will not do the work for
            you!</em></strong> &nbsp;If you would like us to service your bike,
            our staff mechanics would gladly do so for our <a href=

            participants must sign a waiver before their first visit and sign
            in every subsequent visit.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;">There
            is no need to make an appointment, but space is limited and is
            first come, first serve.&nbsp; Participants are not allowed to work
            on their bikes outside of designated Fix Your Bike
            Hours.</span></p>
